# Useful .bashrc

When I'm doing my job I'm trying to set my working place as efficient and useful as it's possible. 

Bash terminal is my main everyday program I'm using that's why I decided to improve it a little.

Time displaing, inter- and intranet ip-addresses, working directory, listing files due changing dirs, splitting the outputs and other stuff which make work easier and faster. 

Usage example:
1. For users /* <user_name> is your user name, e.g. kali */
--------------
```
mv /home/<user_name>/.bashrc /home/<user_name>/.bashrc_old
cp ./bashrc_user /home/<user_name>/.bashrc
bash
```
2. For root
```
mv /root/.bashrc /root/.bashrc_old
cp ./bashrc_root /root/.bashrc
bash
```
