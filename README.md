# Useful .bashrc

When I'm doing my job I'm trying to set my working place as efficient and useful as it's possible. 

Bash terminal is my main everyday program I'm using that's why I decided to improve it a little.

Time displaying, inter- and intranet ip-addresses, working directory, listing files due changing dirs, splitting the outputs and other stuff which can make your work easier and faster. 

Usage example:
1. For users
------------
```
$ mv /home/<user_name>/.bashrc /home/<user_name>/.bashrc_old
$ cp ./bashrc_user /home/<user_name>/.bashrc
$ bash
```
2. For root
```
# mv /root/.bashrc /root/.bashrc_old
# cp ./bashrc_root /root/.bashrc
# bash
```
